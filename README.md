## About the game (rules and goals)

It is a card game which begins with all cards being closed. At every turn a player opens two cards and closes them if they don't 
match (are not identical). 
The goal is to memorize positions of pair cards and open them at one turn till all cards are matched. 

A player has unlimited number of guess and there is no time limitation. A player can choose among several topics depicting 
historical places of Vilnius or particular moments of it's life. 

At the end of the game all cards are opened and a player is able to click on pictures to see larger version of them. 
A short description is displayed under the clicked picture.

At any time of the game a player is able to start the game from the begining or change a topic.
